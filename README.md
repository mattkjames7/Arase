# Arase
A module for downloading and reading Arase spacecraft data.

## Installation

Install from PyPI:

```bash
pip3 install Arase --user
```

or

```bash
python3 -m pip install Arase --user
```

Set the `ARASE_PATH` variable by placing the following at the end of `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
export ARASE_PATH=/path/to/arase/data
```

## Downloading Data

Most instrument data can be downloaded using the `DownloadData` function
contained in the instruments submodule, e.g.:

```python
Arase.XXX.DownloadData(L,prod,StartYear=StartYear,EndYear=EndYear,Overwrite=Overwrite)
```

where `XXX` can be replaced with the instrument names: `HEP`, `LEPe`, `LEPi`, `MEPe`, `MEPi`, 
`MGF` or `XEP`. `L` is an integer and `prod` is a string which correspond to the
level and data product provided by the instrument, repsectively (see the table in "Current
Progress"). `StartYear` and `EndYear` determine the range of years to download data for.
`Overwrite` will force the routine to overwrite existing data.

This method will work for PWE data:

```python
Arase.PWE.DownloadData(subcomp,L,prod,StartYear=StartYear,EndYear=EndYear,Overwrite=Overwrite)
```

where `subcomp` is the sub-component of the instrument (see table below).

To download the position data:

```python
Arase.Pos.DownloadData(prod,StartYear=StartYear,EndYear=EndYear,Overwrite=Overwrite)
```

where prod is either `'l3'` or `'def'`. The `'def'` option is needed for
position-related functions elsewhere in the `Arase` module.

## Position and tracing

1. Download position data:

```python
Arase.Pos.DownloadData('def')
```

2.  Convert to a binary format (this allows for quicker reading):

```python
Arase.Pos.ConvertPos()
```

3. Save field traces

```python
Arase.Pos.SaveFieldTraces(Model=Model,StartDate=StartDate,EndDate=EndDate)
```

where Model is either `'T89'`, `'T96'`, `'T01'` or `'TS05'` (`'T96'` by default).
`StartDate` and `EndDate` are the start and end dates to perform traces for,
both are integers of the format yyymmdd.

4. To read the position data :

```python
pos = Arase.Pos.GetPos()
```

To read the traces:

```python
tr = Arase.Pos.ReadFieldTraces(Date)
```

## Reading Data

### MGF data

```python
data = Arase.MGF.ReadMGF(Date)
```

This returns a `numpy.recarray` object which contains the time-series data.

### Particle Omni-directional Spectra 

```python
data = Arase.LEPe.ReadOmni(Date)
```

For other instruments, replace `LEPe` with one of the following: `LEPi`,
`MEPe`, `MEPi`, `HEP` or `XEP`. `data` is a dictionary which will contain
dates, times, energy bins and instances of the `SpecCls` object. The `SpecCls`
object contains all of the spectral information stored within it, and is 
usually identified by the dictionary key containing `'Flux'`. The `SpecCls`
object has an in-built method for plotting the spectrograms, e.g.:

```python
data['eFlux'].Plot()
```

will plot the electron flux spectrogram from the LEPe data loaded above. 
To list the keys of a dictionary, use `list(data.keys())`

###	3D Particle Spectra

These data are not currently placed into an object like `SpecCls`, this
may change once I have access to PAD data. For instruments which provide 3D spectra,
there is a function `Read3D` which will simply read the CDF file for a
given date, and list all of the data and corresponding metadata into
two dictionarys, e.g.:

```python
data,meta = Arase.LEPe.Read3D(Date)
```

### Combined Particle Spectra

Two functions are available which will load the data for multiple instruments
at the same time.

For electrons:

```python
E = Arase.Electrons.ReadOmni(Date)
```

and for ions:

```python
H,He,O = Arase.Ions.ReadOmni(Date)
```
where `E`, `H`, `He` and `O` are all instances of `SpecCls`.

### Single Spectra

The `SpecCls` object has the ability to return single spectra, e.g.:

```python
import Arase
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

#read in the electrons - this should work with and SpecCls object
spec = Arase.Electrons.ReadOmni(Date)

#for the energy bins and particle flux data
e,dJdE,_ = spec.GetSpectrum(Date,ut)

#for velocity and phase space density
v,f,_ = spec.GetSpectrum(Date,ut,PSD=True)

#or to plot
plt.figure(figsize=(8,4))
ax0 = spec.PlotSpectrum(Date,ut,PSD=False,Split=True,fig=plt,maps=[2,1,0,0])
ax1 = spec.PlotSpectrum(Date,ut,PSD=True,Split=True,fig=plt,maps=[2,1,1,0])
plt.tight_layout()

#for more information, read the docstrings:
spec.GetSpectrum?
spec.PlotSpectrum?
```

* &#10004; - Works
* &#10006; - Not working yet. In the case of 3D data, a `SpecCls3D` object needs to be written. For MGF and level 3 hfa data, it's a simple case of plotting a line.
* &#10013; - Probably works, but have no access to the data to be able to test it.
* &#10033; - Currently 3D spectra can only be read into dictionaries as a `SpecCls3D` object is needed.
